# Demographics of Croatia 2021

My team and I graphically presented some aspects of Croatia's society including religiousness, minorities and centralization on a geographical level. 

For this endeavour we used **Python** inside the **Google Colab** environment with the help of numerous libraries such as **Pandas** for database manipulation and **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** and **Plotly** for the graphical representation of data.
